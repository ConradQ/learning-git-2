			<h3>EARTH SONG</h3>
			<h5>Michael Jackson</h5>
			<p>What about sunrise<br>
			What about rain<br>
			What about all the things<br>
			That you said we were to gain...<br>
			What about killing fields<br>
			Is there a time<br>
			What about all the things<br>
			That you said was yours and mine...<br>
			Did you ever stop to notice<br>
			All the blood we've shed before<br>
			Did you ever stop to notice<br>
			This crying Earth this weeping shores?</p><br><br>
			<h6>Zwrotka</h6>
			<p>Aaaaaaaaaah Uuuuuuuuuuuh<br>
			Aaaaaaaaaah Uuuuuuuuuuuh</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<p>What have we done to the world<br>
			Look what we've done<br>
			What about all the peace<br>
			That you pledge your only son...<br>
			What about flowering fields<br>
			Is there a time<br>		
			What about all the dreams<br>
			That you said was yours and mine...<br>
			Did you ever stop to notice<br>
			All the children dead from war<br>
			Did you ever stop to notice<br>
			This crying Earth this weeping shores?<br><br>
			Aaaaaaaaaah Uuuuuuuuuuuh<br>
			Aaaaaaaaaah Uuuuuuuuuuuh</p>
		</div>
		<div class="container">
			<p>I used to dream<br>
			I used to glance beyond the stars<br>
			Now I don't know where we are<br>
			Although I know we've drifted far<br><br>
			Aaaaaaaaaah Uuuuuuuuuuuh<br>
			Aaaaaaaaaah Uuuuuuuuuuuh<br>
			Aaaaaaaaaah Uuuuuuuuuuuh<br>
			Aaaaaaaaaah Uuuuuuuuuuuh</p>
