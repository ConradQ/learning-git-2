		<h1>EARTH SONG</h1>
		<h4>Michael Jackson</h4>
		<p>What about sunrise<br>
		What about rain<br>
		What about all the things<br>
		That you said we were to gain...<br>
		What about killing fields<br>
		Is there a time<br>
		What about all the things<br>
		That you said was yours and mine...<br>
		Did you ever stop to notice<br>
		All the blood we've shed before<br>
		Did you ever stop to notice<br>
		This crying Earth this weeping shores?<br><br>
		Aaaaaaaaaah Uuuuuuuuuuuh<br>
		Aaaaaaaaaah Uuuuuuuuuuuh</p><br><br>
		<p>What have we done to the world<br>
		Look what we've done<br>
		What about all the peace<br>
		That you pledge your only son...<br>
		What about flowering fields<br>
		Is there a time<br>
		What about all the dreams<br>
		That you said was yours and mine...<br>
		Did you ever stop to notice<br>
		All the children dead from war<br>
		Did you ever stop to notice<br>
		This crying Earth this weeping shores?<br><br>
		Aaaaaaaaaah Uuuuuuuuuuuh<br>
		Aaaaaaaaaah Uuuuuuuuuuuh</p><br><br>
		<p>I used to dream<br>
		I used to glance beyond the stars<br>
		Now I don't know where we are<br>
		Although I know we've drifted far<br><br>
		Aaaaaaaaaah Uuuuuuuuuuuh<br>
		Aaaaaaaaaah Uuuuuuuuuuuh<br>
		Aaaaaaaaaah Uuuuuuuuuuuh<br>
		Aaaaaaaaaah Uuuuuuuuuuuh</p><br><br>
