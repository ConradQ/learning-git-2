		<h1>EARTH SONG</h1>
		<h4>Michael Jackson</h4>
		<p>What about sunrise
			What about rain
			What about all the things
			That you said we were to gain...
			What about killing fields
			Is there a time
			What about all the things
			That you said was yours and mine...
			Did you ever stop to notice
			All the blood we've shed before
			Did you ever stop to notice
			This crying Earth this weeping shores?</p>
